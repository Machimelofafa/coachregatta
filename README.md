## Accessibility

The chart uses a colour-blind friendly palette generated with an LCH scale.
Colours are declared as CSS variables in `index.html` and retrieved via
`getColor` from `palette.mjs`. Dataset strokes are 2&nbsp;px wide and maintain a
contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against the white background.
